Xifroon Lab
===========

Introduction
------------
Xifroon Laboratory is small IT team that leads in development of many small
software projects. The main goal is benefiting people through small usable
software.

Benefiting people is defined as helping them to do things significantly easier.
Do things can be anything from small work into a great one.

### Name
Xifroon, spelled like 'sifrun', is composed from alphabet X and word sifroon.
X symbolize number ten, whereas sifroon is Arabic word meaning zero.
Overall, we have ten and zero, yes, we are hundred!

We want to provide a great number of benefit not necessarily lots of member, as
we keep our team as small workable as possible.

### Logo
![Xifroon Lab Logo](design/icon-hd.png)

Our logo as our name, constructed from X and zero. But the X alphabet is union
of two sharp brackets. The logo means to bring our identity and goal at instance.

We are visionary small software developer team, code is our meals!

### Laboratory Suffix
It is illegal for me to _just put_ suffix like 'Inc.', 'Co.', 'Ltd.', etc.
Well, they're cool suffix but not easy to wear on. Therefore, we use lab because
we are now a small starter team and possibly experimenting much in our works.

So, laboratory seems a proper suffix, right?

Movement
--------
We do the following,
1. Bring old, unmaintained project which potentially benefiting people into
   resurrection.
2. Build project or joining into other project which matching our mission.
3. Build platform or tools to encourage beneficial project.
4. More..

Guideline
---------
I don't want to introduce much guides and rules. But Xifroon Lab try to be
consistent across our works and thus need some unification in view and method.

Then we introduce the following,
+ [Contributing guide] : For those want to contribute, this one is the start
+ [Coding guide] : Coding style and technique, should contains rationale
+ [Project guide] : Necessary for project setter, to keep project organized

Read them as you need to do related work.

Project
-------
We are developing in multi domain project now ranged from desktop, mobile, and
web. We try to be open source but have flexibility on this one.

### Minbar
Our first project will be minbar application.

### Project Toolkit
To easily following [Project guide], we craft this software.
